- Live sports betting arbitrage bot. Monitors odds from desired markets between Kalshi and Bet105 for arbitrage opportunities.

# Tech stack
- Node.js backend to handle websocket connections and arb logic. React frontend to present current arbs in a sorted listbased on profit %, and a dashboard including statistics such as average arb time (probably need to implement DB at this stage), profit per session, and other useful indicators/functionalities to be determined as the project moves forward.
